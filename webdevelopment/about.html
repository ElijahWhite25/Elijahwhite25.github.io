    <h3>Professional Background</h3>

  <p>
    Who is Elijah White? I’ve always considered myself a hands-on worker who stays calm when things get busy. My background in high-volume environments—from the fast-paced front counter at KFC to the logistics-heavy world of Online Grocery Pickup at Walmart—has taught me how to multitask without losing sight of the customer’s experience. I’ve learned that whether you’re managing transactions or coordinating complex orders, clear communication is what keeps a team moving.

    <h3>Community Involvement</h3>

  <p>
    Outside of my professional shifts, most of my time is now spent training the young kids on the basketball court. I’m deeply committed to youth development because I’ve seen firsthand how the discipline and teamwork required in sports translate perfectly to a professional setting. I try to bring that same 'team-first' energy and work ethic to everything I do, whether I'm coaching a drill or managing a project.
