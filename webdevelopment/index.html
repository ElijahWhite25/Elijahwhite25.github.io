  <h3>Welcome to My Website</h3>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m Elijah White. Welcome to my digital professional space—a look at my journey from the front lines of retail to community leadership and beyond.
    Purpose & Goals: I’ve spent the last few years working in high-energy, fast-paced environments where every minute counts. Whether I was managing complex logistics at Walmart or ensuring quality service at KFC, I learned that a team’s success depends on two things: clear communication and a solid work ethic.
    I’m now focusing that same energy on my transition into a professional career that combines my background in customer operations with my passion for mentorship. This website is a snapshot of where I’ve been and the technical skills I’m currently sharpening. My goal is simple: to bring a “hardworking mindset” to every project I touch—staying disciplined and helping the team around me get better every day.
